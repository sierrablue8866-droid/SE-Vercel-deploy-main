# 🔐 GitHub Secrets Setup Guide — Sierra Estates

This file documents every secret required by the GitHub Actions workflows.
Go to: **GitHub → Your Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

## ✅ REQUIRED FOR BUILD TO PASS

These secrets are needed by both `ci.yml` and `deploy-vercel.yml`.

Without them the build will still pass (it uses `ci-placeholder` fallbacks),
but the live app will not connect to Firebase.

| Secret Name | Where to get it | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Firebase Console → Project Settings → Web App | Public key, safe to expose |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | Firebase Console → Project Settings | e.g. `yourproject.firebaseapp.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Firebase Console → Project Settings | e.g. `sierra-estates-12345` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Firebase Console → Project Settings | e.g. `yourproject.appspot.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Firebase Console → Project Settings | Numeric ID |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Firebase Console → Project Settings | Starts with `1:` |

## 🚀 REQUIRED FOR VERCEL DEPLOY

| Secret Name | Where to get it | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VERCEL_TOKEN` | vercel.com → Account Settings → Tokens → Create | Personal access token — keep private |

> The `VERCEL_ORG_ID` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` are already committed in
> `.vercel/project.json` (non-secret, safe to commit).

## How to add secrets

1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** (top tab)
3. Click **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** (left sidebar)
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Paste the name and value exactly as shown above

> 💡 **Tip**: If a workflow shows "skipped" in GitHub Actions (yellow circle),
> it means the required secrets for that job are missing — this is safe and
> by design. The workflow won't fail, it just won't run that job.
