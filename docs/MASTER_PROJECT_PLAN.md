# Sierra Estates — Unified Master Project Plan & Execution Roadmap

**The Single Authoritative Source of Truth for Architecture, Milestones, and Release Progress**

---

## 1. Executive Summary & System Overview

**Sierra Estates** is an enterprise-grade luxury PropTech intelligence platform engineered specifically for the New Cairo real estate market. It combines:
- **Authoritative Backend**: Supabase PostgreSQL (`gaxfqcietzoonlmatiot.supabase.co`) with `pgvector` embeddings, real-time queues, and strict Row-Level Security (RLS).
- **Dual-Domain Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router) serving the buyer client experience at `https://sierra-estates.net` and the administrative command deck at `https://admin.sierra-estates.net`.
- **7-Layer Autonomous Agent Fleet**: Coordinated AI agents (Matchmaker, Closer, Valuation Scorer, Concierge, Voice Transcriber, Legal Contract Generator, Orchestrator).
- **Shared Memory Brain Engine**: A unified RAG engine fusing the **Obsidian Knowledge Vault** (`docs/obsidian-vault/`) and the **Episodic Context Cache (ECC)** for fleet-wide active goal alignment.
- **Real-Time Omnichannel Gateway**: OpenWA WhatsApp Gateway and n8n engine hosted on dedicated AWS EC2 (`18.232.148.172`), enforcing strict owner privacy via fallback to helpline `+201092048333`.
- **Spatial Intelligence Masterplan Engine**: Interactive Leaflet map featuring precision GPS bounding polygons and subfeatures (Crystal Lagoons, Green Spines, Golf Courses) for all 18 top New Cairo compounds.

## 4. Verification Standards & Quality Gates

Every commit and release is gated by automated verification:
1. **Zero Working Tree Drift**: Clean git tree verified via `pnpm deploy:check`.
2. **Canonical Backend Integrity**: 100% of data reads/writes verified against Supabase PostgreSQL.
3. **Strict Privacy Policy**: Zero real owner phone numbers in client bundles (strict fallback to `+201092048333`).
4. **TypeScript & Bundles**: Clean `tsc --noEmit` and `next build` across all 105 routes.
5. **Test Coverage**: 152 test suites and 1,592 automated tests passing with zero failures.
