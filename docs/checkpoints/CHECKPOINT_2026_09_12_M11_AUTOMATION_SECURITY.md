## 1. Executive Summary & Executed Cards

### Card M11.1: Enforce CI-Gated Deployment and Full Release Validation (`card_8e54b10abe`) — **DONE**
- **Changes**:
  - `.github/workflows/deploy-vercel.yml`: Added `gate` job preceding `deploy`, verifying that CI completed successfully for the commit via `gh run list --workflow=ci.yml --commit=$SHA`.
  - Added `emergency_override` input on `workflow_dispatch` with mandatory audit logging to prevent catastrophic deployment lockouts while forbidding silent bypasses.
  - Added `actions: read` permission to GitHub Actions workflow.
  - Preserved instant agility for preview target deployments (`target.name == 'preview'`).
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Added `push: branches: [main]` trigger so commits to `main` initiate CI and trigger downstream Vercel deployment automatically.
  - `package.json`: Hardened `deploy:prod` script to enforce pre-flight readiness checks (`pnpm deploy:check && vercel --prod`).
  - `__tests__/deployment.test.ts`: Added comprehensive test coverage for CI gating, emergency overrides, and preview bypass.

### Card M11.2: Normalize Admin Authorization and Malformed-Cookie Handling (`card_f5ce2c79d1`) — **DONE**
- **Changes**:
  - `apps/sierra-estates-realty/lib/server/auth-guard.ts`: Defined and exported single canonical role authority:
    ```ts
    export const ADMIN_CONSOLE_ROLES = ['admin', 'manager', 'superadmin'] as const;
    export function isAdminConsoleRole(role: unknown): boolean;
    ```
  - Normalized `verifyAdminRequest` so `manager` role is treated consistently alongside `admin` and `superadmin`.
  - `apps/sierra-estates-realty/app/api/admin/auth/route.ts`: Switched role checks to `isAdminConsoleRole` across GET and POST handlers, synchronizing API route behavior with `auth-guard.ts`.
  - `apps/sierra-estates-realty/lib/auth.ts`: Hardened `parseCookies` with `try/catch` around `decodeURIComponent(v)` so malformed percent-encoded cookie strings fail closed without crashing request handlers with 500 errors.
  - Added unit tests in `apps/sierra-estates-realty/__tests__/server-auth-guard.test.ts`, `apps/sierra-estates-realty/__tests__/auth-session.test.ts`, `__tests__/api-routes-and-cron-contracts.test.ts`, and `__tests__/admin-page-contracts.test.ts`.
